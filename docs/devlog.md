# Developer Log

---

## 2025-08-29 — Project Kickoff

### What I did
- Created the repo: `jobba-the-hunt` (JobHunt Buddy).
- Bootstrapped a Next.js 15 app with TypeScript, Tailwind, ESLint.
- Chose modern defaults (src dir, App Router, Turbopack, default alias).
- Verified the dev server runs successfully at `localhost:3000`.

### Decisions & Why
- **Name:** Picked *Jobba-the-Hunt* / JobHunt Buddy → ties directly to my job search and becomes a strong story in interviews.  
- **App Router:** Went with Next.js App Router → aligned with modern best practices.  
- **Repo Structure:** Added `/docs` folder with `backlog.md`, `design.md`, `devlog.md` → shows evolution, not just code.  

### Next Steps
- Replace boilerplate README with project scope + MVP.  
- Add first system design draft (`design.md`) → high-level diagram + DB schema.  
- Populate backlog with MVP features and possible enhancements.
